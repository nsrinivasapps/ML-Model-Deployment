<h3>Model Deployment Strategies</h3>
<br>Through many years working with clients, it's clear that much of the analytics / machine learning activities in an organization are focused on data exploration, analysis, and eventually generating a prediction (regardless of the wide variety of modeling techniques that are available). For good reason, the model exploration and model prep takes a lot of time. Next comes model tournaments in order to train and compare the model fit statists, which help to determine the best model. 
<br>
<br>At this point, you have a powerful and extremely valuable model... but <b>how do you deploy your predictive model into production?</b>
<br>
<br>This repo contains a few of my ideas and strategies for deploying your models in production and at scale:
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;Deploy as a Batch Process
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;Deploy as a Web Service (REST API)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;Deploy online as part of a real-time data stream
