<h3>Model Deployment Strategies</h3>
<br>As Data Scientists, we spend so much time exploring the data, working on transformations, enriching our core data with external sources, all the work in between to prepare our model pipeline, and then eventually training a machine learning model (whether a regression model, classifier, clustering algorithm, etc.)
<br>
<br>At this point, you have a powerful and extremely valuable model...but it's worthless if it is not deployed in production within your organization. 
<br>
<br><h5>So how do you deploy your model into production?</h5>
<br>
<br>This repo contains a few of my ideas, strategies, and code for deploying your models in production and at scale:
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Deploy as a Batch Process
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Deploy as a Web Service (REST API)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Deploy online as part of a real-time data stream
